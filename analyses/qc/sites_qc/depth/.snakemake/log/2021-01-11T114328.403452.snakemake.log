Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	all
	1	plot_depths
	2

Error in rule plot_depths:
    jobid: 1
    output: results/plots/depthFilter.png
    shell:
        Rscript scripts/plotDepths.R results lowdepth highdepth
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job plot_depths since they might be corrupted:
results/plots/depthFilter.png
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
